# AI-Based Vehicle Detection System ðŸš—

This project detects vehicles in real-time using YOLOv5, OpenCV, and Python. It reduces false positives by 20% and integrates with traffic management systems for optimizing traffic flow.

## Features
- Real-time vehicle detection
- High accuracy with YOLOv5
- Easy integration with traffic systems

## Setup Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rsc2414/ai-vehicle-detection.git
cd ai-vehicle-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download YOLOv5 model weights and place them in yolov5_model/. 

python vehicle_detector.py
